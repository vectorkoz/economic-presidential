    "Now, since numbers of votes are different state-by-state and in time, it's better to analyse them comparatively. Here, new values are created by calculating proportions of votes and differences between them for each year and state. By convention, Democratic votes will go first, so if the value of 'dr_percent' is positive, then the Democratic candidate won the election in that exact state and year, otherwise, the Republican candidate won."
