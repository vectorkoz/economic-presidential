# economic-presidential
This repo contains 2 projects exploring the relationship between economic indicators and results of U.S. Presidential elections from 1976 to 2020, while using using Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, pandas, geopandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn.

Note: feature-selection-linear-regression was completed in September 2023, 2020-US-presid-election-by-state-classification was completed in January 2024.
## Brief summary of the projects
 - Data cleaning, data wrangling, creating a custom dataset
 - Feature engineering
 - Linear Regresssion models
 - Feature selection with Lasso Regression
 - Logistic Regression models
 - Support Vector Machines (with and without kernels)
 - Random Forest models
 - Gradient Boosting models
 - Ensemble learning
 - Model explanations: Gini importance, permutation feature importance, LIME.
 - Choropleths (geographic plots).
 - High scores achieved predicting 2020 election results on 1976-2016 data (see below).
